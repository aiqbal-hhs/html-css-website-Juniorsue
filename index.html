<h1>History of netball</h1>
<p>Netball emerged from early versions of basketball and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an association football that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.[14] Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. Physical education instructor Senda Berenson developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to women's basketball. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.[15] The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.</p>
<p>From the start, it was considered socially appropriate for women to play netball; netball's restricted movement appealed to contemporary notions of women's participation in sports, and the sport was distinct from potential rival male sports.[11][22] Netball became a popular women's sport in countries where it was introduced and spread rapidly through school systems. School leagues and domestic competitions emerged during the first half of the 20th century,[23][24] and in 1924 the first national governing body was established in New Zealand.[20] International competition was initially hampered by a lack of funds and varying rules in different countries. Australia hosted New Zealand in the first international game of netball in Melbourne on 20 August 1938; Australia won 40â€“11.[20] Efforts began in 1957 to standardise netball rules globally: by 1960 international playing rules had been standardised, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball, later the International Netball Federation (INF), was formed to administer the sport worldwide.[12]</p>

<h1>Gender</h1>
<p>Men's netball teams exist in some areas but attract less attention from sponsors and spectators.[38] Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985.[39] In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams to compete in the Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships.[39] By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union.[40][41] Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.[42] Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gender teams are largely self-funded.[39]

An all-transgender netball team from Indonesia competed at the 1994 Gay Games in New York City.[43] The team had been the Indonesian national champions.[43] At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with the highest rates of transgender athletes participating.[44] There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender.[44] They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea.[44] Teams with transgender players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.[44]</p>
<h1>Major championships</h1>
<p>There are four major international netball competitions; the Netball World Cup, Netball at the Commonwealth Games, Netball Quad Series and Fast5 Netball World Series. Netball is also played at large regional multi-sport events such as the Southeast Asian Games.

Netball's important competition is the World Netball Championships (also known as the Netball World Cup), held every four years. It was first held in 1963 at the Chelsea College of Physical Education at Eastbourne, England, with eleven nations competing. Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to win a championship title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points at the end of the round robin, and there were no finals.[99]

The Fast5 Series is a competition among the top six national netball teams, as ranked by the INF World Rankings.[100] It is organised by the INF in conjunction with the national governing bodies of the six competing nations, UK Sport, and the host city's local council.[101] The All England Netball Association covers air travel, accommodation, food and local travel expenses for all teams, while the respective netball governing bodies cover player allowances.[102] It is held over three days, with each team playing each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams advance to the semi-finals; the winners face each other in the Grand Final.[103] The competition features modified fastnet rules and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens.[104][105] A new format featuring shorter matches with modified rules was designed to make the game more appealing to spectators and television audiences.[104] The World Netball Series was held annually in England from 2009 to 2011.

Netball gained Olympic recognition in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying.[11][106] Although it has never been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future.[107][108] Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources.[26][109][110] Some funding sources became available with recognition in 1995,[111] including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.[111][112]</p>
